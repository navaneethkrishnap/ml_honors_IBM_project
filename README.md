Few classifiction Algorithms are applied to predict weather it rains or not ( i.e., Target Variable "RainTomorrow" )
those classification algorithms are Linear Regression,Logisitic Regression, KNN, Decision Tree and Support Vector machines 
also metrics such as accuracy_score, log_loss, jaccard_score,f1_score, mean_absolute_error and mean_squared_error are applied to evaluate the performance of each classifications models. 

This dataset contains observations of weather metrics for each day from 2008 to 2017.
